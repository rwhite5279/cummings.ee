  "text": "I have seen her stealthily frail\nflower walking with its fellows in the death\nof light,against whose enormous curve of flesh\nexactly cubes of tiny fragrance try;\ni have watched certain petals rapidly wish\nin the corners of her youth;whom,fiercely shy\nand gently brutal,the prettiest wrath\nof blossoms dishevelling made a pale\nfracas upon the accurate moon....\nAcross the important gardens her body\nwill come toward me with its hurting sexual smell\nof lilies....beyond night’s silken immense swoon\nthe moon is like a floating silver hell\na song of adolescent ivory.",
